        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm Andrey Stoimenov and I'm 23 years old. I'm from Sofia, Bulgaria. Technology has always been part of my life. Altough I'm into arts right now, I aspire to shift career paths and get into Web Development and IT. Right now I'm learning and practicing actively with different online resources and platforms. I'm taking "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu in Udemy.
            This is one of my first HTML projects. More to come! &#128516; </p>
